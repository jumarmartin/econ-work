# Is Investment in High Speed Rail Socially Profitable  (2008)
1. "We estimate the minimum level of demand required from which investment in HSR could be considered profitable from a social perspective." (3)
    - "This paper concentrates on time savings from deviated traffic, the willingness to pay of new traffic, and changes in resource costs of competing modes; so the levels of demand required to justify the investment are obtained under the assumptions of the relative unimportance of additional benefits" (6)
2. "The economic rationale for the construction of new HSR depends heavily on the expected volume of demand, which is also very sensitive to the line length and population density." (5)
3. The paper creates a base case without Highspeed rail (6) and then expands on such with theorhetical appliques and even more some theorhetical equations.
4. "Our results show that investment in HSR infrastructure can scarcely ever be justified on the basis of time savings alone and the net willingness to pay of generated traffic." (21)
5. 
6. Mostly theorhetical which could serve as as strong base to the motivation in finding some empirical data. 


# Estimating Economic and Development Impacs of Transit Investments (1974)
1. "Reported in this paper is an empirical analysis of economic and development impacts from a study of major transit investment for the Seattle area, using state-of-the-art econometric and spatial interaction models." (1)
2. "Improved accessibility from city and suburban areas,
especially for peak-hour work trips , should benefit
the Seattle CBD (central business district) job levels (and other economic and
development activity)." (6)
3. This paper only looks at the amount of jobs added in contrast to capital expenditures and household differences between different districts/areas, zero regressions; quite simple.
4. "In general, the results tend to conform to the expectations outlined previously." (6)
5. As with most papers, this paper is looking at only one particular place, Seattle. Something encompassing would be quite nice and(!) the analysis was quite simplistic; what if we tried to actually estimate?
6. This paper contains little-to-no theory and more empirical data from Seattle Washington. What's great about this is that it provides a place we could expand upon this (this paper is quite old) to see an economic impact. Interestingly, I have a friend who worked for King County Metro and could get data on their economic equity programs and the impact

# The effects of new public projects to expand urban rail transit (2000)
1. "To document the demographic groups who are over represented in tranist growth areas an the changes in transit usage by different demographic groups." (241)
2. "Extending transit lines makes public transit more accessible and reduces the time cost of commuting by public transit. Commuters who live in census tracts now closer to public transit have a greater incentive to use it. Public transit use in such areas may rise both due to incumbent mode switching and due to population sorting. As transit access improves, public transit users have a greater variety of communities to choose among." (243)
3. Methods
    - "This paper uses a unique panel data set to evaluate the effects of recent rail transit expansions. We measure the extent to which new rail transit induces commuter mode switching toward transit, which demographic groups gain the most from rail improvements, and how rental and home prices are affected by transit." (242)
    - "We exploit the variation in transit access changes among census tracts within five cities to evaluate the effects of transit expansions." (243)
    - "Tract level variation in proximity to public transit allows us to estimate richer econometric models than can be estimated using aggregate city level annual data." (243)

        - Fixed Effects
        - measures propensity to use public transportation
        - ptu = cFE + central_city_dummy + controlling for tract demographics + tract distance rom public transit
        - second regression to account for tract-level effects, change in public transit use (249)
        - \Delta$Public Transit Use$_{ijt} = $city fixed effects$_{j} + \psi^{*}$CC$_{ijt} + B\Delta{X}_{ijt} + \gamma(\Delta$distance$_{ijt}) + \Delta{U}_{ijt}
        - Third regression to control for commuter sorting effect in regression 2 due to "use \[that\] can rise because incumbent tract residents change their behavior or because migrants to newly accessible tracts have higher public transit commuting propensities than incumbent residents." (250) Using Generalized Least Squares and Instrumental variables where 1980 migratio nrate enters as an instrument to the 1990 migration rate.
        - Other regressions to measure benefits for loca residents other than commuting (increased acess to shopping and socialization), which demographic groups gain from new transit (251) through the probability to use public transit in 1990.
4. Results
    - Better access to transit encourages more use (sec. 6.1)
    - Evidence from hedonic capitalization regressions confirm that transit is an amenity.
    - "In all the cities together, the poor reduced transit use from 24.6 to 18% between 1980 and 1990." (257)
    - "...that blacks and the young were not served by transit expansions, probably because of the tendency for expansions to be in suburban, or outer-center city areas. The college educated and home owners were over-represented in census tracts which were closer to public in 1990 relative to 1980." (259)
5. "...One possible extension of this research would be to use hedonic methods to study whether cities that build rail experience an improvement in their cross-city quality of life ranking." (261)
    - "The hedonic method is a regression technique used to estimate the prices of qualities or models that are not available on the market in particular periods, but whose prices in those periods are needed in order to be able to construct price relatives." [OECD on Hedonic Methods](https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=1225#:~:text=The%20hedonic%20method%20is%20a,able%20to%20construct%20price%20relatives.)
6. This paper provides significant empirical data and regressions to allow for a great jumping point for future research. In tandem with information that San Diego et al. are also building transit (as of the publishing of the paper), we can go far with this paper.
