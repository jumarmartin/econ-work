	abstract = {The development prospects of a poor country or region depend in part on its capacity for innovation. In turn, the productivity of its innovators, whom are often concentrated around urban centers, depends on their access to technological knowledge. The emigration of highly skilled individuals weakens local knowledge networks (brain drain) but may also help remaining innovators access valuable knowledge accumulated abroad (brain bank). We develop a model in which the size of the optimal innovator Diaspora depends on the competing strengths of co-location and Diaspora effects for accessing knowledge. Then, using patent citation data associated with inventions from India, we estimate the key co-location and Diaspora parameters. The net effect of innovator emigration is to harm domestic knowledge access, on average. However, knowledge access conferred by the Diaspora is particularly valuable in the production of India’s most important inventions as measured by citations received. Thus, our findings imply that the optimal emigration level may depend, at least partly, on the relative value resulting from the most cited compared to average inventions.},

We distinguish between the knowledge diversion and knowledge creation effects of such emigration, and show that the remaining residents of a country can gain from emigration, even when tastes for knowledge goods exhibit a kind of 'home bias'. In contrast to existing models of beneficial brain drain ({BBD}), our results do not require agglomeration economies, education-related externalities, remittances, return migration, or an emigration 'lottery'. Instead, they are driven purely by the public nature of knowledge goods, combined with differences in market size that induce greater knowledge creation by emigrants abroad than at home. {BBD} is even more likely in the presence of weak sending-country intellectual property rights ({IPRs}), or when source country {IPR} policy is endogenized.},

We assume that agents are heterogeneous in skills and take their educational decisions in a context of uncertainty regarding future migrations. We distinguish two growth effects: an ex ante “brain effect” (migration prospects foster investments in education because of higher returns abroad), and an ex post “drain effect” (because of actual migration flows). The case for a beneficial brain drain ({BBD}) emerges when the first effect dominates, i.e., when the average level of human capital is higher in the economy opened to migrations than in the closed economy. We derive the theoretical conditions required for such a possibility to be observed. Using cross-section data for 37 developing countries, we find that the possibility of a {BBD} could be more than a theoretical curiosity.},

the subsequent national increase in skilled immigration from these

	abstract = {This paper reviews four decades of economics research on the brain drain, with a focus on recent contributions and on development issues. We first assess the magnitude, intensity, and determinants of the brain drain, showing that brain drain (or high-skill)
migration is becoming a dominant pattern of international migration and a major aspect of globalization. We then use a stylized growth model to analyze the various channels through which a brain drain affects the sending countries and review the evidence on these channels. The recent empirical literature shows that high-skill emigration need not deplete a country's human capital stock and can generate positive network externalities. Three case studies are also considered: the African medical brain drain, the exodus of European scientists to the United States, and the role of the Indian
diaspora in the development of India's information technology sector. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the analysis for education, immigration, and
international taxation policies in a global context. ( {JEL} F02, F22, J24, J61, O15)},

	abstract = {How does inventors’ migration aﬀect international talent allocation, knowledge diﬀusion, and productivity growth? To answer this question, I build a novel two-country innovationled endogenous growth model, where heterogeneous inventors produce innovations, learn from others and make dynamic migration and return decisions. Migrants interact with individuals at origin and destination, creating a network that diﬀuses knowledge within and across countries. To quantify this framework, I construct a micro-level dataset of migrant inventors on the {USEU} corridor from patent data and document that (i) gross migration is asymmetric, with brain drain (net emigration) from the {EU} to the {US}; (ii) migrants increase their patenting by 42\% per year after migration; (iii) migrants continue working with inventors at origin after moving, although less frequently; (iv) migrants’ productivity gains spill over to their collaborators at origin, who increase patenting by 18\% per year when a co-inventor emigrates. I calibrate the model to match the empirical results and study the impact of innovation and migration policy. A tax cut for foreigners and return migrants in the {EU} to eliminate the brain drain increases {EU} innovation but lowers {US} innovation and knowledge spillovers. The former eﬀect dominates in the ﬁrst 25 years, increasing {EU} productivity growth by 5\%, but the latter dominates in the long-run, lowering growth by 6\%. On the migration policy side, doubling the size of the {US} H1B visa program increases {US} and {EU} growth by 9\% in the long run, because it sorts inventors to where they produce more innovations and knowledge spillovers.},
